Iterator vs Enumeration:


Between Enumeration and Iterator, Enumeration is older and its there from JDK1.0,
 while iterator was introduced later.
 Iterator can be used with ArrayList, HashSet and other collection classes. 
 Another similarity between Iterator and Enumeration in Java is that  functionality of Enumeration interface is 
duplicated by the Iterator interface
Only major difference between Enumeration and iterator is Iterator has a remove() method while Enumeration doesn't.
 Enumeration acts as Read-only interface, because it has the methods only to traverse and fetch the objects,
 where as by using Iterator we can manipulate the objects like adding and removing the objects from collection
 e.g. Arraylist.


Also Iterator is more secure and safe as compared to Enumeration
 because it  does not allow other thread to modify the collection object while some thread is iterating over
 it and throws ConcurrentModificationException. 
This is by far most important fact for me for deciding between Iterator vs Enumeration in Java.


Enumeration
hasMoreElement()
nextElement()
N/A


Iterator
hasNext()
next()
remove()
